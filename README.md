# arch-linux-bash
.sh AKA bash files for installing certain desktop environments.
karch.sh will help you install KDE plasma
while
garch.sh will help you install GNOME desktop

Honestly idk how to run these (how to make them be allowed to execute), or even to just make them locally available on an arch machine... 

but here is a rough guide about how I would do it if I know all the commands:
1. download one of these files and copy them to a usb flash drive
2. copy the files from the usb flash drive to your root's home folder
3. make the file allowed to be executed
4. run the command in your home directory: ./[k- or garch.sh]
