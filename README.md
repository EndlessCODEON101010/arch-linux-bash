# arch-linux-bash
.sh AKA bash files for installing certain desktop environments.
karch.sh will help you install KDE plasma
while
garch.sh will help you install GNOME desktop

Here is a rough guide about how I would do it if I know all the commands:
1. download one of these files and copy them to a usb flash drive
2. copy the files from the usb flash drive to your root's home folder
3. make the file allowed to be executed with chmod +x [karch or garch]
4. run the command in your home directory: ./[k or g arch.sh]

with karch: ./karch.sh
with garch: ./garch.sh
